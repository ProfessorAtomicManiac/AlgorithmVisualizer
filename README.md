# AlgorithmVisualizer
Now has a video explaining the project/code: https://youtu.be/D_J2BEeXRWA <br>
If you only want to see its functionality see: https://youtu.be/8AfptLWbQBQ <br>

Work in progress. Using pygame to do all the work (although I'm still pretty unfamiliar with python in general)<br>
Hopefully when its done it will have the following features:<br>
Currently finished with visualizing sorting algorithms<br>

Still in progress (Probably suspended until next year): <br>
-Visualize graph algorithms on a grid or a graph with nodes<br>
&emsp;-DFS and BFS<br>
&emsp;-Shortest paths/Minimum spanning Tree (Djistra's, Prim's, Kruskal's)<br>
&emsp;-Topological Sort<br>
-Custom graph creator<br>
&emsp;-Can drag nodes and edges<br>
&emsp;-Can make nodes/edges have special properties (Ex: Bipartite)<br>
-Visualization of Data Structures<br>
&emsp;-Trees<br>
&emsp;-Heaps<br>
&emsp;-DSU<br>
&emsp;-Stack/Queues/Priority Queues<br>
-Others<br>
&emsp;-KMP String Matching<br>
